A machine learning-powered credit scoring system for Ethereum wallets with Reputation-Backed Delegation Credit System (RBDCS) capabilities, built on the philosophy of embracing beautiful contradictions in decentralized finance.

## The Beautiful Contradictions Approach

This project embraces the inherent contradictions in blockchain credit systems as a source of strength:

- **Transparency vs. Privacy** - Balancing public blockchain data with zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure
- **Trust vs. Trustlessness** - Building reputation systems on trustless infrastructure
- **Centralized Scoring vs. Decentralized Validation** - Using ML models while preserving decentralized verification
- **Individual Merit vs. Community Vouching** - Blending personal transaction history with reputation delegation
- **Code is Law vs. Human Judgment** - Combining algorithmic decisions with reputation-based context

Rather than attempting to eliminate these tensions, our system thrives in their intersection, creating a more nuanced and effective credit scoring mechanism.

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è On-chain security analysis with malicious address detection
- ü§ñ Machine learning model for credit score prediction (300-1000 range)
- ü§ù Reputation-backed credit delegation system
- üîç Comprehensive wallet analysis report
- üîÑ Integration with Ethereum blockchain via Web3.py
- üìä Synthetic data generation for model training
- üõ†Ô∏è Mock mode for delegation system testing
- üîê Zero-knowledge proofs for selective information disclosure
- ‚öñÔ∏è Contradiction-aware scoring that balances opposing metrics

## Installation

1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/ethereum-credit-scorer.git
cd ethereum-credit-scorer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
echo "INFURA_URL=your_infura_url" > .env
echo "ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key" >> .env
```

## Configuration

Replace in code:
```python
# ========== CONFIGURATION ========== #
INFURA_URL = "your_infura_url"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "your_etherscan_key"
```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python credit_scorer.py
```

Sample input:
```
Enter Ethereum wallet address (0x...): 0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F
```

## Key Components

### Credit Score Factors

Our scoring system embraces complementary contradictions:

| Traditional Factor | Contradictory Factor | Synthesis |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Account age | Recent activity relevance | Time-weighted activity assessment |
| ETH balance | Velocity of funds | Productive capital efficiency |
| Transaction count | Transaction quality | Weighted interaction significance |
| Security history | Risk-taking innovation | Context-aware risk assessment |
| Individual merit | Community validation | Reputation-backed scoring |

### RBDCS Features

- **Credit delegation tracking**: Allow addresses to vouch for others
- **Reputation scoring**: Building trust in a trustless environment
- **ZKP-enhanced privacy**: Selective disclosure while maintaining verifiability
- **Delegation capacity calculation**: Dynamic assessment of vouching power
- **Collateral-backed boosts**: Skin-in-the-game reputation enhancement

### Contradiction-Aware Scoring Logic

```python
def calculate_balanced_score(wallet_data):
    # Example of balancing contradictory factors
    long_term_stability = assess_account_age(wallet_data.age)
    recent_relevance = assess_recent_activity(wallet_data.recent_txs)
    
    # Finding higher synthesis between contradictory indicators
    temporal_score = synthesize_time_factors(long_term_stability, recent_relevance)
    
    # Similar synthesis for other contradiction pairs...
    return final_synthesized_score
```

## Security Analysis

- Malicious address detection while recognizing legitimate pattern similarities
- Mixer transaction monitoring with legitimate privacy-preserving use cases
- Risk scoring system that balances security with innovation potential
- Historical transaction audit with forward-looking behavioral prediction

## Delegation System

```python
class DelegationManager:
    def delegate_credit(self, delegator, delegatee, amount, private_key):
        """
        Implements reputation delegation while preserving individual accountability
        by synthesizing the contradiction between social vouching and personal merit.
        """
        # Delegation logic
```
